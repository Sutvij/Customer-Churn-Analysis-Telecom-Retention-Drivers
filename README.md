# Customer Churn Analysis: Identifying Retention Drivers in Telecom

### 📅 Project Duration: Jun 2025 – Aug 2025  
### 🔧 Tools: Power BI, DAX, Data Visualization, Dashboard Design

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes why customers churn from a telecom provider using a large dataset of **7,000+ customers and 29 variables**.  
The objective was to uncover **actionable retention drivers** and identify **high-risk customer segments** using scalable analytics and interactive Power BI dashboards.

### 🔍 Key Insights

- **Geographic Risk:** California shows a **63% churn rate**, **2.3×** the national average.  
- **Demographic Vulnerability:** Seniors (**65+**) churn **2.5×** more than younger customers.  
- **Retention Levers:** Contract structure and group plans significantly reduce churn — group contracts show a **40% reduction**.

## 🧠 Methodology

A structured approach inspired by **CRISP-DM**:

### 1. Data Validation
- Detected and resolved duplicate customer IDs.  
- Verified churn rate accuracy and data consistency across all states.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Mapped churn patterns by demographics, contract types, and geographic regions.
- Used segmentation analysis to isolate high-risk customer groups.

### 3. Advanced Modelling & Dashboarding
- Built an interactive **Power BI dashboard** featuring:
  - Dynamic filtering (age groups, contract types, group plans)
  - State-level churn heatmaps  
  - Cohort analysis charts  
  - Drill-through pages for customer profiles  

### 4. Insight Extraction
- Applied visualization best practices to identify root causes of churn.
- Combined geographic mapping with demographic segmentation to enhance model precision.
